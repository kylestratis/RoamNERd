Media caption Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick says all police "are mourning a great loss"
The Met chief said the policing family was "deeply shocked and very sad" following the death of the officer.

"I have visited and spoken to our officer's partner together with other colleagues and we are of course giving her the best support we can," she said

"My heartfelt condolences go to her, to their family, to his colleagues and his close friends.

"A murder investigation is under way and officers are working at several crime scenes to secure evidence and to establish the facts of what happened.

"Early indications are that the suspect shot himself, this has not yet of course been established as a fact."

Det Insp Richard Berns described his colleague as "hard working and an inspiration to all who knew him".

"It was a privilege to have worked with him and known him over so many years," he said.

"He was was one of a kind and will be deeply missed. Rest in peace my friend."

Community police officer Jacqueline Kufuor was among those laying flowers outside the custody centre in tribute to her colleague.

She described the officer as "a lovely guy" and "the nicest man I have ever met".

An investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is under way and will have several strands, our correspondent Danny Shaw added.

"It's likely to focus on the circumstances of the man's arrest - which officers were deployed during the operation; whether and how the suspect was searched; and if he was put into handcuffs," he said.

"The IOPC will also need to establish what happened at the police station and whether appropriate measures were put in place when the suspect was taken out of the police van."

The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the police were currently "reviewing the safety of custody suites" and "there could be changes very soon to custody suites to make sure they are as safe as they can be".

Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: "We owe a huge debt to those who risk their own lives to keep us safe."

In a post on social media he also said: "My deepest condolences go to the family, friends and colleagues of the police officer who was killed in Croydon last night."

A number of police officers have also been turning their social media profile pictures black with a blue stripe to pay their respect to the officer.
