This appalling incident in Croydon appears to be absolutely unique - an officer shot by a man who was already inside a police facility - and the shock felt today underlines how rare it is for police officers in the UK to be killed by a suspect in the line of duty, relative to other nations.

The Metropolitan Police officer shot dead in Croydon is the 17th from the force to have been killed by a firearm since the Second World War.

But since the beginning of the 20th Century 73 police officers have been shot and killed by criminals in the UK, excluding all deaths in Northern Ireland.

The majority of those deaths - more than 50 - have occurred since 1945.

Police officers in other parts of the world are often puzzled why British constables are not routinely armed. But the fact is that there are very few criminal guns in circulation - and the culture of policing has never seen it as acceptable to be universally armed.

However, Tasers are increasingly a common sight in the UK - and a massive survey of police officers recently found three-quarters would carry one of the less-than-lethal devices on the frontline, if given the choice.

"There was noise and all of a sudden one ambulance from inside the car park came out and sped off.

"This morning I heard it was a police officer and just felt so sad. They are all very good people and wave and say hello when they come to my shop."

'Sick to their stomachs'
Ken Marsh, chairman of the Met Police Federation, said news of the shooting was "utterly devastating".

"Officers across London are in shock and sick to their stomachs at the nature of his death," he said.

"Sadly, on very rare occasions officers make the ultimate sacrifice whilst fulfilling their role.

"When that happens we will ensure their bravery and sacrifice is never forgotten."
